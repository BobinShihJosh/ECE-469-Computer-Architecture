# 64-bit ARM ALU
Designed a simple 64-bit ARM ALU using only logical gates. That is, built from explicit AND, OR, NAND,
NOR, XOR, INVERTER, etc. gates. No assign statements (except an assign to set a
wire to a constant value or connect wires together), CASE statements, etc. You may
use FOR loops to index into buses as needed.
